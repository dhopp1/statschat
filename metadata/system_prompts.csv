Using Pandas, manipulate the dataset so that you can best answer the initial prompt. Create the output dataset in long format. Save the output in a variable called '{result_dataset_name}'. 
The functions have already been called, there is no need to call them again or define the dataframes manually in code, use the data already stored in the variable names described.
